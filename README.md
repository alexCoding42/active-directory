## Steps

1. I setup a Windows 2019 Server and Active Directory on a virtual machine.
2. I configured two Network Adapters for the Domain Controller: one for external network (Internet) and one for Internal Network (client).
3. I configured Domain, Remote Access, NAT and DHCP.
4. I setup a Windows 10 virtual machine as client and linked it to the domain.
